I'm a software engineer currently working at Sensedia, with a knack for diving into way too many side projects in my free time.

I'm always open to discussing technology, sharing ideas, or collaborating on interesting projects across various programming languages and domains. Whether it's backend, frontend, or data science, I'm eager to learn and contribute. Feel free to reach out through [email](mailto:luis@lutheir.com?subject=Hey) or [twitter/x](https://x.com/luistebaf).
